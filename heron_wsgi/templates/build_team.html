    HERON (Healthcare Enterprise Repository for Ontological Narration) is a search discovery tool that allows KUMC faculty members to search de-identified data 
    from various hospital and medical center sources including Epic/O2 (the hospital electronic medical record). By combining the various data sources, researchers 
    can look at the data in new ways not available when viewing data in one source at a time.
