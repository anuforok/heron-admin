HERON Human Subjects Training Lookup
====================================

The HERON login system uses an outboard HTTP service to check for
human subjects training.


KUMC Local Approach
-------------------

`pom.xml` and `src/` are the JDBC approach developed in August 2011 to
access records kept in a MS SQL database at KUMC.


CITI Web Service
----------------

Records are now kept by Collaborative Institutional Training
Initiative (`CITI`__).

We're investigating the `â€‹CITI SOAP and REST Services In BETA`__.

Challenges
++++++++++

Notes on shopping for a python SOAP client are in requirements.txt

We seem to be able to get their WSDL and call `HelloWorld`::

  (citi)~/projects/chalk-checker$ python traincheck.py me
  INFO:pysimplesoap.helpers:GET https://webservices.citiprogram.org/SOAP/CITISOAPService.asmx?WSDL using urllib2 2.6
  INFO:__main__:client: <pysimplesoap.client.SoapClient object at 0x1f61450>
  INFO:pysimplesoap.client:POST https://webservices.citiprogram.org/SOAP/CITISOAPService.asmx
  INFO:__main__:CITISOAPService.HelloWorld(): {'HelloWorldResult': 'Hello World'}

But it's not clear whether `HelloWorldbyUser` is working::

  INFO:pysimplesoap.client:POST https://webservices.citiprogram.org/SOAP/CITISOAPService.asmx
  INFO:__main__:byUser: {'HelloWorldbyUserResult': 'Authenticated as KUMC_Citi. You have No level access. You are linked to No Institution associated with this account. Institution.Your status is InValid'}

And when we try `GetCompletionReports`, we get an exception parsing the result::

  INFO:pysimplesoap.client:POST https://webservices.citiprogram.org/SOAP/CITISOAPService.asmx
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    File "traincheck.py", line 35, in main
      reports = client.GetCompletionReports(usr=usr, pwd=pwd)
    File ".../pysimplesoap/simplexml.py", line 475, in unmarshall
      raise TypeError("Tag: %s invalid (type not found)" % (name,))
  TypeError: Tag: schema invalid (type not found)
