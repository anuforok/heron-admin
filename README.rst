This repository is a mixure of a java approach and a python approach
to our i2b2 oversight tools.

apache-conf - proxy configuration for the Java approach

apache-conf-raven - mod_wsgi configuration for the python approach

.classpath
.pmd
.project
.settings - eclipse gorp
.wtpmodules

heron_wsgi - the python approach

.hgignore - stuff to ignore from version control (e.g. maven's target/)

pom.xml - maven package object model (build file) for the Java approach,
          which is being phased out

src - the java approach
