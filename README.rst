This repository is a mixure of a java approach and a python approach
to our i2b2 oversight tools.

apache-conf - proxy configuration for the Java approach

apache-conf-raven - mod_wsgi configuration for the python approach

.classpath
.pmd
.project
.settings - eclipse gorp
.wtpmodules

heron_wsgi - the python approach

.. todo:: administrative interface: POST to re-read config files

.hgignore - stuff to ignore from version control (e.g. maven's target/)

pom.xml - maven package object model (build file) for the Java approach,
          which is being phased out

src - the java approach


Object Capability Style and Dependency Injection

* `Dependency Injection Myth: Reference Passing`__ Oct 2008 by Mi≈°ko
   Hevery, an Agile Coach at Google where he is responsible for
   coaching Googlers to maintain the high level of automated testing
   culture. It motivates passing in any source of non-determinism as
   a constructor arg, for testability.

* `Security of emakers`__ motivates passing in any source of authority (and any source
   of non-determinism seems to be a source of authority) as a constructor arg.

injector gotchas
****************

When you see this::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/dconnolly/raven-frontiers/heron_wsgi/admin_lib/heron_policy.py", line 433, in make_stuff
        hr = depgraph.get(HeronRecords)
    ...
      File "build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/injector.py", line 467, in provider_for
        elif isinstance(to, interface):
    TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a class, type, or tuple of classes and types

Look for one of the constructor args to HeronRecords that isn't bound.
