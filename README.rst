HERON regulatory enforcement web interface
******************************************

The Healthcare Enterprise Repository for Ontological Narration (HERON)
is a method to integrate clinical and biomedical data for
translational research. The bulk of the functionality is provided by
i2b2__; this code is the regulatory enforcement web interface.
